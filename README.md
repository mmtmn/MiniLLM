# MiniLLM

MiniLLM is a simple and lightweight Language Model (LM) implemented in Python using the Keras library. It is designed to be trained on a laptop with moderate computational power, making it accessible for experimentation and learning purposes.

## Features

- Basic Language Model architecture using LSTM and Embedding layers
- Trainable on a laptop with moderate computational power
- Generates text based on the trained model
- Customizable hyperparameters for experimentation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MiniLLM.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your training data:
   - Create a list of text sequences and assign it to the `texts` variable in the code.

2. Customize the model hyperparameters (optional):
   - Modify the values of `vocab_size`, `max_length`, `embedding_size`, and `lstm_units` according to your requirements.

3. Train the model:
   - Run the script to train the model on your training data.

4. Generate text:
   - Provide a seed text by assigning it to the `seed_text` variable in the code.
   - Run the script to generate text based on the trained model.

## Example

```python
# Prepare the training data
texts = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "The lazy dog sleeps all day long.",
    "The quick brown fox is very agile and fast."
]

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=128, epochs=10)

# Generate text using the trained model
seed_text = "The quick brown fox"
generated_text = generate_text(model, tokenizer, seed_text, max_length, num_words=20)
print(generated_text)
```

## Limitations

- The generated text may not be highly coherent or meaningful due to the simplicity of the model architecture and limited training data.
- The model's performance depends on the quality and diversity of the training data.
- The model may require fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization for better results.
